# The anatomy of web APIs

## Types of APIs
- SOAP -> XML
- REST -> resource-based
- GraphQL -> query-centric which means it only returns the keys you ask instead of everything like REST

## API Data Interchange formats
- JSON
```
{
  "key": "value",
  "int": 1
}
```
- XML
- YAML: human-readable format that is indentation-based

## Authentication
To prove who you are
### basic authentication
Http
- unencrypted
- base 64 encoded

### API keys
unique strings used in URL or headers or cookies. They are sent with every requests sicne APIs are stateless

### JSON Web Token (JWT)
Used for token auth.

3 parts:
- header for algorithm info
- payload: data + token
- signature: encoded + encrypted message to validate the token

### HMAC: Hash-based Message Authentication Code
Primarly used by AWS to hash request data and API key to validate

### OAuth 2.0
- Authorization for service-to-service communication between two implementers
- Requires only authorization e.g.: authorizing an application to login with your Github account
- Limited time-based token generated by the provider
- user: resource owner
- client: who ask you to access another service
- authorization server: who receive the demand to access its data
- widden the attack surface
- security risks when not implemented properly

### no auth
Used whe nno sensitive data is exchanged. Might not be ideal since we often want to rate limit a connexion and prevent abuses
